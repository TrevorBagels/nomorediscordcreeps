## Setup and installation

First, do some configuration. You'll need your discord token (`token`), Pushover application key (`pushover_token`), and Pushover user key (`pushover_user`).

Next, install the requirements.
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Now, you're ready to run the program.
```
cd dev
python3 -m program
